# 👋 Hi, I'm Faisal Ali  
### Embedded Hardware Engineer | Electrical Engineer | PCB Designer

I am a **hands-on Embedded Hardware Engineer** with strong expertise in **PCB design, embedded systems, and product development**.  
I work at the intersection of **electronics, firmware, and manufacturable hardware**, taking ideas from **concept → prototype → production**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design **production-ready PCBs** for embedded & IoT products
- Develop **low-power embedded firmware**
- Work on **wearable electronics, audio hardware, and sensor systems**
- Debug hardware at **signal, board, and system level**
- Collaborate closely with firmware, mechanical, and product teams
